# 🎧 Naive Bayes Spotify Classifier

**An AI Programming Assignment for UND Computer Science Students**

This project teaches students how to apply **Naive Bayes classification** on a real-world dataset (Spotify music data) to predict whether a song is likely to be a **hit** based on its audio features.

## 📚 What You'll Learn

- Probabilistic learning with Naive Bayes (Continuous/Gaussian)
- Real-world data cleaning and preprocessing
- Evaluation using classification accuracy
- Auto-grading with assert checkpoints
- Optional: confusion matrix & threshold tuning

## 🚀 How to Start

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Navigate to the `src/` folder.
3. Open and complete `naive_bayes_project.py`.
4. Run the script — all **assert** statements must pass!
5. Fill out the **multiple choice answers** inside the script.
6. (Optional) Complete the bonus tasks for up to +10 points.
